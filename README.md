#First-Responsive-Into-Web
It was the first fully responsive website I developed as a Front-End developer in 2021 for practice. It was basically a portfolio website inclusive of some software development services. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap. I used a Google font named Poppins in this project.
